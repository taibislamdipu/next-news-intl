      'Jonathan Haidt says smartphones and the algorithms that run on them are rewiring the brains of younger generations. Image: Observer Smartphones are turning our young people into the anxious generation, Jonathan Haidt tells Tom Faber. The first thing Jonathan Haidt asks when we sit down is my age. I know what he’s thinking: he wants to place me, technologically. Am I a member of the "anxious generation", the term he has coined for the young people who he believes have been psychologically harmed by social media and smartphone use at a tender age? Or am I more likely to be one of the concerned parents who are the primary audience for his book? At 33 (the oldest of his anxious generation are currently 28) and child-free, I don’t quite fit into either camp. I also don’t quite align with either of the two sides that have emerged in response to Haidt’s argument. While his book, The Anxious Generation , has undoubtedly made a splash, sparking a heated public debate about adolescent technology use, the science underpinning his thesis has also met criticism from other researchers in his field. So is the book’s popularity because Haidt has correctly diagnosed an urgent social ailment? Or because he’s spinning parents a story that they desperately want to believe: that there is a simple solution to this complex problem? At 61, with neat grey hair and thick, dark eyebrows, Haidt perfectly embodies the role of affable, credible academic. He currently teaches social psychology at New York University’s Stern School of Business. The starting point for The Anxious Generation is the crisis in young people’s mental health — in his native US and across much of the West. The proportion of children and young people in the United Kingdom with mental disorders rose from 12% to 20% between 2017 and 2023. The question is: why, and what can we do about it? Haidt says the increase in anxiety and depression among young people is directly caused by their use of smartphones and social media. "Gen Z became the first generation in history to go through puberty with a portal in their pockets that called them away from the people nearby and into an alternative universe that was exciting, addictive, unstable, and ... unsuitable for children and adolescents," he writes. He specifically identifies the period between 2010 and 2015 as a time when smartphones and social media were updated to include addictive and harmful features, corresponding with a marked increase in anxiety and depression for children coming of age during this period. Exposure to these technologies during puberty causes long-term effects on the brain, Haidt argues. He calls this "the Great Rewiring". Haidt outlines four ways in which young people are negatively affected by social media and smartphones: sleep deprivation, social deprivation, attention fragmentation and addiction. Since The Anxious Generation was published, he has come to believe the threat to attention is the biggest concern, both for children and adults. "My argument is that these platforms are clearly, demonstrably, harming children at an industrial scale, by their millions," he says. He offers four simple rules to reverse the course of what he calls the "phone-based childhood". These are: no smartphones before 14; no social media before 16; phone-free schools; and more unsupervised play and childhood independence. The suggestions seem reasonable enough. Even some of his critics agree with them. They all require group mobilisation to avoid the "collective action problem" — it’s much harder to enforce a change unless other parents are doing it too. If just one child has no smartphone or social media, they will feel excluded from their peers. As Haidt writes: "Few parents want their preteens to disappear into a phone, but a vision of their child being a social outcast is even more distressing." American social psychologist and author Prof Jonathan Haidt. Photo: Observer In the UK, there was already momentum to this discussion before Haidt’s book. The 2023 Online Safety Act puts more responsibility on tech platforms to ensure they are safe for users, especially children. It is one reason that Haidt calls the UK "the leading country on protecting kids online". Some critics claim Haidt is exacerbating a moral panic. Just as previous generations of adults claimed television, hip-hop, video games and comic books were corrupting the youth, they say Haidt is the latest avatar of the old guard inventing horror stories around new culture and technology they don’t understand. Despite his avuncular demeanour and his pleasant habit of murmuring agreement with me while I speak, Haidt has arrived ready to prove every point in his book. "There certainly have been moral panics," he says, "and whatever technology the kids are using, the adults are going to be sceptical of. It’s a valid criticism as a starting hypothesis. The obligation is on me to show this time is different. And I can very easily do that." His response to the moral panic accusation is twofold. One: he argues there has never historically been an introduction of new technology followed so directly by a precipitous global decline in youth mental health. Two: in previous generations, if you asked children how they felt about their comic books or video games, they would say they loved them, please don’t take them away. But when young people today are surveyed about social media, significant numbers regret how much they use it, find them harmful, and in some cases wish they’d never been invented. So what is the controversy around the data? It boils down to a single, difficult question. Experts agree that mental health problems among teenagers are rising at the same time as smartphones and social media are playing increasingly ubiquitous roles in their lives. But is this mere correlation? Or is the technology causing the mental illness? Several prominent academics have argued that Haidt’s claim of causation is an oversimplification; that there is no one simple answer to such a complex sociological problem. A particularly searing review in the academic journal Nature argued that Haidt’s central thesis "is not supported by science" and that "the bold proposal that social media is to blame might distract us from effectively responding to the real causes of the current mental-health crisis in young people". Others have argued that the research around this topic is unreliable and ambiguous, or even conducted studies that contradict Haidt’s claims. Sonia Livingstone, a social psychologist at the London School of Economics who researches children’s lives in the digital age, says we don’t know which way the data points: are smartphones causing poor mental health in children? Or are children with poor mental health turning to smartphones for entertainment and escape? Academics have also offered alternative reasons why young people might be struggling, from the state of global politics to the economy, to the environment. Haidt raises a couple of these in his book and claims they don’t fit his timeline, but other experts are not so quick to dismiss the other theories. On his blog, Haidt has posted a series of detailed responses to his critics. Ultimately, there’s enough doubt to concede that there is no scientific consensus around the topic. So how much public policy and parenting advice do we want to generate from unsettled science? Haidt argues it’s better to act before it’s too late. He writes: "At a certain point, we need to take action based on the most plausible theory, even if we can’t be 100% certain that we have the correct causal theory. I think that point is now." Perhaps part of the reason that Haidt riles up members of the scientific establishment is because of how he positions himself publicly — as part scientist, part crusader. He is adept at self-promotion and has turned his book launch into a global campaign, telling me his goal is to "roll back the phone-based childhood in three years". Photo: Getty Images There is also some blurriness around Haidt’s politics, which is tricky considering how easily children’s issues become politicised. He grew up in a secular Jewish family in Scarsdale, New York, and once identified as a Democrat. But Haidt now calls himself a centrist and uses conservative-coded language — for example describing himself on Joe Rogan’s podcast as "an extremely alarmed patriotic American citizen who sees my country going to hell", and later comparing the revolution he’s leading in the digital environment to the fall of communism in 1989. The fact that his book does not mention the threat to boys of far-right radicalisation from "manosphere" influencers, as chillingly depicted in the TV show Adolescence , could be because of a reluctance to alienate his engaged conservative fanbase. When I put this to him, he bats away the question, saying: "that didn’t occur to me". Reading Haidt’s book, I couldn’t help reflecting on my own teenage years online. I had many positive experiences and made significant friends on forums and online video games at a time when I felt I didn’t fit in at school. When I was coming to terms with my sexuality aged 14, I found vital resources and community on the internet. The Anxious Generation argues that digitally-mediated relationships are inherently less meaningful than their real-life counterparts. This is not true in my experience. Where the book does bring up the benefits that can come from virtual communities, they are briefly raised and then tossed aside. In our conversation, Haidt points out that I grew up on a different, less harmful version of the web, before social media companies deliberately employed addictive design features such as algorithmic feeds, conversation streaks and auto-playing videos to juice users for maximum engagement, and therefore maximum profit. This is true — the internet of my formative years was a simpler one. But does that really mean young people can’t have positive experiences on today’s social media? Haidt concedes that the internet can still be a valuable resource for marginalised groups such as queer people, but he also says that these groups are disproportionately the target of online harassment and abuse. In his view, the cons outweigh the pros. Livingstone disagrees. "Haidt puts these two sides on the scales and says the bullying outweighs the expression and finding your community, but there are some really good things here. We need to work out how to regulate big tech so that the bullying stops and the hate is not amplified." We should try to curtail tech companies’ addictive, data-driven business models to make social media platforms better, safer places before resorting to an outright ban, she says, while noting it is very hard to mobilise politicians about children’s wellbeing when there are major dollars on the table from big tech lobbying. There are benefits to social media too, she says. "Children are absolutely clear that they love being in touch with their friends. They love that when something bad happens, they can get social support. When they’re stuck at home and their parents are fighting, they can go somewhere and say: ‘Bloody hell, dad’s shouting at mum again’." Livingstone believes that we need to look at the question with a wider lens. "What do we think a good childhood looks like?" she asks. "If we don’t let children go on social media till they’re 16, what is our plan for them being in touch with their friends? Are we going to let them out after school and let them walk home by themselves and hang out at the bus stop, or are we going to report them as hoodlums and menaces?" We live in a world where we have welcomed technology into every crevice of our work, social and leisure time. Countless services force us to create digital accounts to access them; educational technology is being rolled out across schools; AI is being inserted everywhere. "We have invested in tech across the board," Livingstone says. "It’s becoming our infrastructure. And in that context, to say ‘kids shouldn’t be anywhere near it’ — what’s the vision in terms of restricting them, and what is the vision in terms of providing something better for them?" "We can ban smartphones," she says, "but we’re not going to make kids happy overnight." — The Observer',

      "Hyundai Engineering & Construction has introduced its smart sleep environment solution, ‘Hey Sleep,’ aimed at enhancing residential well-being through advanced sleep technology. (Image courtesy of Hyundai Engineering & Construction) SEOUL, June 21 (Korea Bizwire) — Hyundai Engineering & Construction (Hyundai E&C) unveiled an artificial intelligence-based sleep environment solution on Thursday, as South Korea’s leading builder accelerates efforts to integrate wellness technologies into residential living. The new system, dubbed “Hey, Sleep,” uses AI to analyze individual sleep patterns and automatically optimize environmental factors such as lighting, air quality, humidity, and sound to create a personalized sleep environment. The technology continuously learns from a user’s routines and biological rhythms, adjusting settings in real time. For example, if the system detects frequent tossing and turning during sleep, it may alter humidity levels or initiate ventilation based on the specific time and conditions. The accumulated sleep data can be compiled into individualized reports and optionally shared among family members as part of broader health monitoring. “Hey, Sleep” also includes wellness-oriented content: guided meditation, calming music, and breathing exercises before bedtime , as well as motivational audio messages and quotes to help users start their day positively. Hyundai E&C’s solution is the first in South Korea to receive the “Good Sleep Mark Gold” certification , the highest rating awarded by the Korea Sleep Industry Association for excellence in sleep environment quality. Developed in collaboration with healthcare tech firms specializing in sleep sensing and climate control, the system will be deployed in Hyundai E&C’s upcoming residential projects, including the redevelopment of Apgujeong District 2 in Seoul. The initiative is part of the company’s broader strategy to expand “Care-Living” — a residential concept that fuses smart home innovation with preventive health features. “Our goal is to design homes that actively promote well-being,” a Hyundai E&C spokesperson said. “We plan to incorporate ‘Hey, Sleep’ into flagship developments, positioning sleep quality as a key element of future living.” Lina Jang (linajang@koreabizwire.com)",

      "Cosy heat pumps pretty much run themselves, but if you do need to change the settings, it’s easy to do from the Octopus Energy App. This blog guides you through the different controls, what they’re for and how you use them. Getting to grips with the basics Open the Octopus Energy app and select the Devices tab. Your heat pump will appear showing the current heating and hot water temperatures. Tap the tile to make changes.At the top of the screen, you’ll see tabs to switch between your home’s space heating zones and hot water system, allowing different “zones” to be heated separately.Below these tabs in a separate box, you’ll see the temperature reading for your primary Cosy pod. In this example, the primary Cosy pod in the kitchen is 19°C.In the middle of the screen you’ll find the target temperature wheel with plus and minus temperature controls. Change the temperature by sliding the wheel or using the buttons.Near the bottom of the screen, you’ll see controls for Boost, Schedule, Off and On. You can read more about these functions below.Exploring Cosy ModesSchedule (far left) is the most cost-effective way to heat your home. If you change your temperature in a different mode, it will override your schedule until the end of that time slot.Off (middle) stops heating but maintains a protective temperature of 7o C. As heat pumps are designed to run continuously, it’s best to only use this if you’re away 24+ hours.On (far right) is “manual”mode — your Cosy will work to maintain this temperature around the clock. Once it reaches this temperature, it will go into standby mode.Boost (middle of the Zone control screen) increases the temperature for a short burst. You’ll have the option to set a temporary temperature target and duration.Good to know when changing modesSwitching between modes will adjust the heating for your whole home, across all zones.If your home has multiple zones, you’ll have a control tab for each zone where you can set a schedule or change the temperature for each area. If any of your zones fall below their target temperature, Cosy will send heat there (no zone is prioritised over the other and Cosy will work to get all of them just as warm as you need!)Set a heating schedule Your schedule is divided into 7 days with time slots for all 24 hours of the day. Use these time slots to set the target temperature – also called your set point – for every half hour.The shortest slot you can set is 30 minutes, but it’s best to set at least an hour to give your Cosy time to bring the system up to the temperature.On the schedule mode, you’ll see a calendar. Tap on any slot to set a target temperature and adjust when the heating starts and ends.Once you’ve set a schedule for the day, you can copy this over to other days — saving time if you want your heating to be the same each day! Tap the copy button in the upper right corner and select the days you want to have the same schedule.Night time schedulesSome people like it cool when they sleep. Others prefer a steady temperature. But, unlike your old boiler, Cosy doesn’t like big drops in temperature as it has to work harder to warm your home again. So keep this in mind when setting your temperature.Good to know when setting a scheduleWhen you set your schedule, you’ll notice each day has 6 heating slots. Don’t worry, you don’t need to adjust your temperature 6 times a day, but you will need to pick a temperature and set a start and end time for each slot.If a slot runs past midnight into the next day, the latest start time you can choose is 23:55, and it must last at least 30 minutes.To set a slot that starts at midnight, just go to the first slot of the next day. For example, if you want your temperature to be 20°C from 22:00 to midnight on Monday and 19°C after that, you’ll need to head into Tuesday’s schedule to set the 19°C period starting at midnight. Monday’s slot will automatically adjust to end at 23:59, so you’ll still have your 20°C until midnight.To keep things simple, the end time is disabled on the first day, so the schedule flows a bit more smoothly.What if you want the heating “off”?Heat pumps work best when they stay on, so instead of turning yours off completely, try dropping the temperature by 1–3°C.Set hot water temperatureSelect the Water tab at the top of your main controls for your hot water system.Schedule (far left) is the mode you’ll nearly always want to use for your hot water needs. We’ll discuss how to best set your schedule a little later.Off (middle) turns your hot water off. Unlike space heating, you’ll see there’s no frost protection setting associated with hot water — here, off means off.On (far right) is for manual temperature control. When your Cosy is set to “On” for hot water it will continue running to keep your hot water at the set temperature target.Important to rememberHot water production always takes priority over space heating. In other words, if your Cosy gets a signal to make hot water and heat your home at the same time, it will always choose to make hot water first and then return to space heating – ensuring you never end up without enough hot water for your shower, bath, or washing up.Top tip: We recommend running your hot water on Schedule rather than On mode to make sure there’s a good balance between your hot water and heating.How to schedule waterThe best way to make sure you have all the hot water you need is by scheduling your Cosy to make hot water in the early morning hours — especially if you’re on our Cosy Tariff.Setting a 60-90 minute hot water schedule at 04:00 will give Cosy time to make lots of water for your morning showers and heat your home ready for when you wake up.Good to know: your hot water should stay nice and hot for most of the day, even if it’s produced first thing. Most people see their water drop about 3oC over 12 hours.You can copy the schedule to other days using the copy button in the right-hand corner.Setting the temperature of your hot water tankWe recommend setting your hot water tank anywhere between 40-50oC, depending on how hot you like your shower. For general use, theres’s no need to go higher than that.Remember: hot water can scald and burn easily. If you have vulnerable people or children in your home, 44oC and below is best to keep everyone safe from accidental burns.Legionella CycleLegionnaire’s Disease is a rare but harmful bacteria that can grow in warm water that goes undisturbed for long periods. It’s not really an issue in residential systems today, but some customers like to run a legionella cycle anyway. If you’d like to, choose one period a week (early on Sunday morning for example) to schedule your hot water for 90 minutes at 60oC. See your Cosy dataBelow the Schedule tile, you’ll find Cosy 6 or Cosy 9 stats. This is where you can see data on your heat pump’s efficiency.You can view the stats as a graph with different timescales:Live (shows the last 30 minutes)Month (shows a full month’s data)Use the arrows to switch between days or months.What the graph shows:Electricity input – the energy used to power your heat pumpHeat output – the amount of heat your Cosy generatesOutdoor temperature – the temperature in your homeJust above the graph, you’ll see your average COP (coefficient of Performance)—the ratio of heat output to electricity input. This updates as you explore different time ranges.All-time dataBelow the graph, you’ll find your total power consumption (all the heat your Cosy has generated) and your Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCOP).SCOP is just your COP adjusted for a whole year. While it might seem counterintuitive, COP is usually higher in winter and lower in summer—that’s because it’s more efficient to heat your home than it is to make hot water.In summer, with little to no space heating, your COP will drop, which can make your SCOP look low until you’ve had a full year of data—so don’t worry if it seems off at first!To find out more about COP and SCOP, and how to use these metrics to check the efficiency of your heat pump, check out this blog. How to take advantage of the Cosy smart tariffIf you’re on our Cosy Octopus smart tariff, you can set up your Cosy System to take advantage of the super low-cost price dips.We recommend setting your target temperature 1-2oC higher than your ideal temperature during these times. So if you like your home to be 21oC most of the time, try setting it to 22oC from 04:00 to 07:00 and from 13:00 to 16:00. This will store a bit of extra heat in your home and allow your Cosy to avoid running in higher-cost periods.We also recommend dropping your schedule set-point back by 2-3oC from 07:00 to 10:00 and from 16:00 to 19.00. This will minimise how much your heat pump will run during these higher-cost periods and maximise savings.If you like a bit of extra heat for the overnight period, you can bump your set-point back up from 22:00 to 00:15 to take advantage of our late-night Cosy dip pricing.Source link",

    content:
      "Abstract Research Summary Newswise — Extant studies suggest that a particular set of means, once in place, prompt entrepreneurs to enact effectual decision-making. However, little is known about how such effectual means are developed, particularly when entrepreneurs' primary means are digital capital rather than pre-existing effectual means. To address this gap, our qualitative research examines an emerging phenomenon in which young people engage in side-hustling through social media. Our findings reveal that entrepreneurs develop effectual means by leveraging digital capital through browsing, consulting, and imitating. This developmental process is significantly streamlined by digital capital's generativity, recommendability, and multimodality, with its cost-effectiveness dynamically assessed to determine the continuity of development. Drawing on these findings, we discuss implications for effectuation theory and entrepreneurship studies. Managerial Summary Entrepreneurs are known to rely on their established means for effectual decision-making. However, little is known about how entrepreneurs make effectual decisions when they possess digital capital but have underdeveloped means for effectuation. This study explores how young side-hustlers on social media build means for effectuation through browsing, consulting, and imitating. The generativity, recommendability, and multimodality of digital capital significantly enhance this developmental process, while cost-effectiveness is continuously assessed to determine whether to proceed. We develop a process model that illustrates how entrepreneurs leverage and optimize digital capital to drive effectuation in the digital age.",

What are sustainable smart cities? What technology underpins them and how is IoT shaping the future of how we live and access services. As cities are more connected they are more observable and manageable. Limiting unseassary energy consumption offers a cost and societal benefit. IoT is stepping in to provide the monitoring and analysis required to help cities capitalise on these benefits. No longer selling tech for tech’s sake, government & municipal users are not interested in adopting tech without clear benefits. Focusing on sustabibilty is providing reassurance and concrete ROI. In this quick discussion, learn about use cases is water metering, electricity usage, waste management, construction surveillance, ecological monitoring and more. Also, benefit from advice and experience from Kore on how to plan and rollout successful smart city projects. Read ebook here: https://bit.ly/3ZH9kxr Source link",

      "Con el objetivo de fomentar las vocaciones STEM entre los jóvenes a través del diseño y el desarrollo de proyectos tecnológicos que den respuesta a necesidades reales de su entorno escolar, la sede de Endesa ha acogido este año la quinta edición de RetoTech en Balears . RetoTech, que este año celebra su décimo cumpleaños a nivel nacional, es una iniciativa impulsada por la Fundación Endesa y desarrollada con la colaboración de la Conselleria de Educación y Universidades del Govern de les Illes Balears, con el fin de estimular proyectos educativos que transformen e innoven en la educación de los más jóvenes mediante el emprendimiento tecnológico. Para hacerlo, RetoTech anima a los centros educativos que quieran participar a diseñar propuestas innovadoras que ofrezcan soluciones tecnológicas reales, capaces de resolver algunas de las necesidades de su entorno escolar. Con la intención de llevar a cabo los proyectos, todos los centros educativos participantes han sido dotados con impresoras 3D y kits de robótica. La quinta edición de RetoTech en las Islas ha sido muy especial, ya que han participado más de 1.000 alumnos y profesores de 24 centros escolares de Balears. Entre ellos, Menorca ha contado con la representación del IES Pasqual Calbó i Caldés de Maó . Un grupo de ocho alumnos han participado durante el curso escolar en un taller celebrado durante las horas de patio y organizado por los profesores de Tecnología. En este espacio, los alumnos han aprendido a usar las impresoras 3D, además de disponer de un espacio y apoyo de los profesores para llevar a cabo diferentes proyectos tecnológicos. La iniciativa a la que han dado forma para la quinta edición de RetoTech Baleares , «Buscando altas temperaturas», ha supuesto la creación de un vehículo dotado con sensor de temperatura con el que detectar calor intenso en diferentes lugares del instituto, así como comprobar si existen personas atrapadas en caso de incendio. Su proyecto supondría una gran ayuda a los equipos de bomberos en caso de fuego. El primer premio en la categoría de Primaria recayó en el Colegio Balmes de Palma por el proyecto «La Sensocápsula», una cabina insonorizada que permite aislarse del ruido externo y el estrés, con la finalidad de ayudar a las personas con autismo y otras necesidades educativas a autorregularse mediante estímulos sensoriales. Los niños participantes en la construcción del proyecto pertenecen a las aulas de Educación Especial del centro. Por su parte, el colegio Agora Portals International School recibió el primer premio en la categoría de Educación Secundaria, por su proyecto «Smart Cane» con el que han creado un bastón inteligente que permite a personas con discapacidad visual mejorar la percepción del entorno, usando sensores de ultrasonido para detectar los obstáculos de alrededor. Los equipos ganadores recogieron el premio en un evento celebrado en la sede de Endesa de Palma y en el que asistió el conseller de Educación y Universidades, Antoni Vera, y el director territorial de Endesa en Balears, Martí Ribas. En palabras de Antoni Vera, «la dedicación, pasión y habilidades en el campo de la robótica de los jóvenes de Balears son verdaderamente impresionantes. Un año más estamos muy contentos de volver aquí y poder premiarlos». Por su parte, Martí Ribas destacó el valor del trabajo en equipo llevado a cabo en todos los proyectos que se han presentado. «Hemos podido ver unos proyectos muy interesantes y un excelente trabajo de equipo que demuestra cómo la innovación y la tecnología pueden dar soluciones a los problemas de la vida real». El pasado 18 en junio el Colegio Balmes de Palma fue premiado con uno de los tres premios nacionales de la gran final celebrada en Madrid . Participaron junto con los ganadores de los territorios de Madrid, Extremadura, Canarias, Aragón, Cataluña y Andalucía. Los proyectos para optar a los tres premios nacionales se presentaron ante un jurado experto durante una intensa jornada que logró reunir lo mejor del talento educativo y tecnológico en una celebración del futuro que ya están construyendo los jóvenes en las aulas. En la décima edición de este gran reto tecnológico han participado más de 10.000 alumnos y 800 docentes de 255 centros educativos españoles, además de 30 centros educativos de Lisboa, donde se celebra por segundo año consecutivo. RetoTech se desarrolla a lo largo del curso escolar en tres etapas. En la primera, los colegios participantes reciben kits con material tecnológico y los profesores acceden a formación semipresencial enfocada en los tres bloques del programa: robótica, programación de aplicaciones móviles y diseño e impresión 3D.

      "For all the huge and hard-won improvements in robotics, it’s a bit hard to get away from the impression that robots are still “clunky” in many ways. They still look and in many ways act steampunk.That’s not where they need to be, and it’s safe to say the sector is well aware of that fact.Enter the word “neuromorphic”. You can expect to see a lot more of that expression as the technology overtakes old-style systems. It’s not really a new expression; it’s been sitting around in backroom jargon for a while, but now it’s center stage. Neural networks have been the foundation of AI development, and it has taken this long to reach their current state.What’s critical about the expression neuromorphic is that this is a whole class of tech in one word. It means neural systems mimicking the human brain, but it’s far more complex. It’s all about functionality at the most basal level.Things like navigation, situational awareness, and coordination of basic movement operations are essential for robots. The human brain does these things instantaneously through the autonomic nervous system. The “mechanical” brain can’t compete in terms of efficiency. Neuromorphic systems have now achieved that.Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has come up with a system called LENS Locational Encoding with Neuromorphic Systems, which is 90% more energy efficient. The LENS system uses neuron-like electrical spikes to manage navigation and operational needs. Whether or not it can get to a truly autonomic operational level is the issue here.QUT may also have hit the magic formula for realism in system design. The critical point here is based entirely on the economic realities of robotic systems.They use far too much energy to do basic things. They’re not “world ready” in a lot of ways. Robots look great in controlled environments, but they’re still at toddler stage for other environments. That’s a severe operational limitation. Add cost of energy to severe operational limitations, and you see the problems.The vast array of types of operational robots aren’t so much autonomous as having their hands held. They’re under some degree of external control, and they’re also networked. Neural systems are essential to free them from these constraints.This is also still the Cambrian era of robotics. We’re at roughly trilobite stage. There’s a lot more to be done. Check out QUT’s robotics search information and you can see how far just about all aspects of robotic systems and designs have to go before they get to the science fiction level.The neuromorphic approach is a fundamental issue:Robots don’t have to be humanoid, but they do have to interact with humans. That is a problem, and the solutions must be trustworthy.As AI keeps proving, human interactions with technologies are hardly perfect. Even simple terminology can get in the way.A human brain works on any number of levels of proficiency and is highly reactive to incoming information and/or tangential information. Robots therefore need to have at least the processing speed to keep up with these erratic interactions. Neuromorphic systems can do that.The AI overview of a search for “AI robotics” ironically proves the point. AI robots are inevitable. This overview defines an obstacle course of interactions and systems issues. Human and AI systems are very different. Working at different speeds and with often very different frames of reference are real stumbling blocks.Neuromorphic tech will eventually remove these obstacles. LENS and LENS-like capabilities are a sort of beacon in the darkness. Energy efficiency equates to system efficiency equates to operational efficiency.This is where robotics needs to go.The post Op-Ed: LENS neuromorphic robotics – The Next Big Thing in tech, and there’s no avoiding it. appeared first on Digital Journal.",

      "﻿ Remember when snow globes were the pinnacle of desktop decoration? Those quaint glass domes with their floating plastic flakes have officially been relegated to the analog past. The OBBOTO Glowbot has arrived to claim that precious real estate on your desk, essentially shrinking the iconic Las Vegas Sphere down to a personal-sized emotional companion. It’s essentially what you get when someone decides to create the world’s first STEM snow globe with 2,900+ individually addressable pixels, AI-powered interactions, and enough emotional intelligence to make your smart speaker look positively stoic by comparison.The spherical design immediately draws comparisons to the $2.3 billion Las Vegas Sphere, but unlike its gigantic inspiration, the OBBOTO fits comfortably on your nightstand while still delivering a visual punch that makes traditional smart home devices look painfully utilitarian. Its hemispherical form houses thousands of light nodes that can display anything from infinity emojis to timers to ambient patterns that pulse with your music. The OBBOTO team has managed to pack an impressive amount of personality into a device that, at first glance, might be mistaken for a particularly sophisticated mood lamp. That, however, would be selling it dramatically short.Designer: OBBOTOClick Here to Buy Now: $159 $249 (36% off) Hurry! Only 72 of 800 left. Raised over $220,000The OBBOTO excels at emotional expression in ways that make Amazon’s Echo devices seem emotionally stunted. The infinity emoji feature transforms the sphere into a reactive face that can display a range of emotions, creating a surprisingly effective illusion of companionship. The sphere’s expressions change based on interactions, time of day, and ambient conditions, giving it an almost pet-like quality without the inconvenience of feeding schedules or walks. This emotional reactivity creates a strangely compelling presence that bridges the gap between a utilitarian smart home device and something that feels genuinely alive. The fact that it can also function as a sunrise alarm clock, gradually illuminating your bedroom with a simulated dawn, adds practical functionality to what might otherwise be dismissed as a novelty item.Built with an impressive array of sensors, the OBBOTO brings genuine situational awareness to your desk. With built-in motion, brightness, and tap sensors, your GlowBot stays perpetually aware of its surroundings. It lights up when you walk by, dims when the sun comes out, and perks up with a friendly tap. The experience feels less like operating a gadget and more like keeping a tiny creature that knows you’re there and vibes accordingly. This ambient intelligence creates interactions that feel natural rather than forced, responding to your presence without demanding your attention.The intelligence behind OBBOTO goes beyond simple sensor triggers. Powered by AI, OBBOTO reacts to time, weather, and movement in ways that feel playful and surprisingly clever. From sunrise glows to moody pixel shifts, it adapts like the geeky little desk buddy you never knew you needed. The onboard AI combines environmental data with your interaction patterns to create responses that feel increasingly personalized over time. This subtle learning capability means your OBBOTO develops a sort of digital personality that reflects your habits and preferences.The companion app transforms OBBOTO from clever gadget to creative canvas. Unlike most IoT devices that force you into rigid patterns, the OBBOTO app hands you the creative keys. You can upload your own pixel art, program mini light shows, and schedule custom routines. The app also allows you to share emotions with other OBBOTO users, sending surprise emojis like a wink, heart, or even a silly poop to another OBBOTO. This social dimension adds an unexpected layer of connection between devices, creating a network of emotional expression that transcends typical smart home functionality.Music visualization with OBBOTO creates a sensory experience that standard smart lights can’t match. Turn on Music Mode, and OBBOTO syncs its glow to your beats, transforming from companion to visual rhythm section. The sphere pulses, shifts, and flows with your music, creating a synchronized light show that enhances rather than distracts from the audio experience. The 2,900+ pixel nodes create surprisingly complex visualizations that respond to different frequencies and intensities, making each listening session visually unique.OBBOTO’s communication style breaks from the voice-assistant paradigm that dominates smart home tech. What’s its language? Light, pixels, and pure personality. No words, just winks, colors, and pixel-powered expressions. From ambient fades to emoji bursts, every flicker says: “Hey, I see you.” This visual language creates a more ambient, less intrusive form of interaction than the typical smart speaker experience. Rather than interrupting your thoughts with voice responses, OBBOTO communicates through presence, creating a companionable atmosphere rather than demanding conversational engagement.The practical features of OBBOTO extend beyond its emotional appeal. It functions as a sunrise alarm clock, gradually illuminating your bedroom with simulated dawn light. The white noise generator provides ambient soundscapes for focus or relaxation. Time, weather, and reminders appear as visual cues rather than audio interruptions. These utility functions integrate seamlessly with OBBOTO’s personality, never breaking character to deliver information. The result is a device that remains consistently charming even when performing mundane tasks.OBBOTO was incubated by Switchbot, a company that most Yanko Design readers will recognize from our consistent admiration of their clever retrofit smart home solutions. This lineage explains the OBBOTO’s perfect balance of whimsy and functionality. Switchbot has consistently demonstrated an understanding of how to make IoT devices that solve real problems without sacrificing personality, and the OBBOTO represents perhaps their most playful creation yet. The emotional intelligence built into the sphere feels like a natural extension of Switchbot’s approach to smart home technology, bringing a level of character and charm that has been noticeably absent from the category.OBBOTO Glowbot pre-orders at $159, a good 90 bucks off its $249 final MSRP. Deliveries are slated for October 2025, and each Glowbot comes with a 12-month warranty. The box includes the Glowbot itself, a power adapter, and quick-start materials. Customization kits and add-on accessories will be rolling out alongside the core device, expanding the Glowbot’s already impressive palette of expression. For anyone seeking a desktop companion that balances emotional connection with practical functionality, OBBOTO offers a compelling alternative to the increasingly homogeneous world of smart home technology.Click Here to Buy Now: $159 $249 (36% off) Hurry!

    title: "Microsoft begins cleanup of legacy drivers from Windows Update",
    author: "invalid@example.com (Alfonso Maruccia)",
    description: null,
    content:
      'Forward-looking: Microsoft has traditionally maintained strong backward compatibility with older hardware and software. However, the company is now working to phase out as many legacy drivers as possible in an effort to streamline the Windows Update process and reduce its overall complexity. According to a recent post addressing partners in the Windows Hardware Program, Microsoft is working to remove legacy drivers from the Windows Update system. The company says the goal is to reduce security and compatibility risks, which is why it is now embarking on this "strategic" initiative – though it will make backward compatibility within the Windows ecosystem significantly worse than before. In the not-so-distant future, Microsoft aims to provide only the most up-to-date, optimal set of peripheral drivers through Windows Update. To achieve this goal, the company will periodically perform cleanup tasks in its driver catalog. As a result, some drivers will no longer be offered to systems that rely on Windows Update. Microsoft explains that the first legacy drivers to be removed will be those that already have newer replacements available via Windows Update. "Cleaning up" means that a particular set of peripheral drivers will expire, and Windows Update will no longer install them on compatible devices. Hardware manufacturers will have the opportunity to request that Microsoft reinstate expired drivers, although they may be asked to provide justification. Microsoft is reportedly aware of the major shift coming with the removal of old driver support from Windows Update, so it plans to roll out the changes in stages. After the initial cleanup, the company will publish a blog post confirming that the first batch of obsolete drivers has been removed. Following that, manufacturers will have a six-month window to request reinstatement of any driver downloads. According to Microsoft, driver removal is a proactive measure aimed at improving security and ensuring higher-quality drivers for Windows users. The company is advising manufacturers to review their current drivers in the Windows Hardware Program , as Redmond intends to make driver cleanup a routine optimization practice. While Microsoft is working to make Windows Update a leaner and more reliable service for delivering patches and other content, it could face pressure to reverse course, just as it did with WSUS driver synchronization in the past. There\'s no doubt Windows Update would benefit from significant optimization, given how often it causes headaches for millions of users. Still, Microsoft remains confident in Windows Update\'s potential to enhance the overall Windows experience by managing various software downloads more effectively.',

      "Multi-touch attribution (MTA) is a waste of time and money. This isn’t a controversial statement anymore. Few disagree except for MTA vendors, and even they have quietly hedged their bets, introducing media mix modeling (MMM) and incrementality testing. Wise.Yet brands continue to fall into the MTA trap. I’ve watched too many marketing teams realize that last-click or platform attribution is leading them astray, only to be sold the seductive promise of MTA.Whether it’s pitched hard by a vendor or by a CMO looking to justify their existence for a 12-month project under the guise of getting our house in order, the outcome is predictably the same: no meaningful changes are made that make a marketing program more profitable.The promise vs. the realityMulti-touch attribution vendors tell a compelling story that sounds almost too good to be true — because it is.The promiseData-driven credit distribution across all touchpoints based on sophisticated statistical modeling and comprehensive customer journey analysis across every touchpoint. Finally, you’ll move beyond crude last-click attribution to elegant, nuanced measurement that captures the full complexity of modern customer journeys.The realityStill click-obsessed: Despite all the sophisticated modeling and data-drivenness, MTA systems heavily weight clicked interactions because they’re the most trackable and reliable data points. You end up with a marginally better-than-last-click attribution wrapped in significantly more complexity and cost.Built on dying data: iOS 14.5+ and other tech changes, cookie deprecation and evolving privacy regulations systematically destroy the data foundation MTA requires. Same optimization mistakes: Even with a theoretically perfect MTA, every touchpoint tracked and accounted for, you’ll still optimize toward attributed performance rather than actual incremental impact. The fundamental flaw remains unchanged. MTA may tell you that someone:Clicked your Facebook ad.Saw a display ad.Watched a YouTube ad.Got served a TikTok ad and a Reel.Searched for you.Saw a Google ad.Then purchased. It cannot tell you which of your ads influenced that purchase decision or whether the customer would have bought anyway.Dig deeper: What your attribution model isn’t telling youThe psychology Beyond the technological limitations, human psychology keeps brands trapped in the MTA cycle.The sunk cost spiralBrands invest so much time, effort and energy (not to mention money) in making MTA work that admitting defeat becomes challenging. The more resources invested, the harder it becomes to walk away, even when the evidence clearly shows it’s not delivering value.The comfort of familiarityBecause MTA isn’t all that different from last-click or platform attribution, it’s easier to get organizational buy-in. Marketing teams comfortable with attribution-based reporting find MTA safer than other measurement methodologies.For years, marketing teams have justified their budgets (and value to the organization) via attribution-based reporting. Changing the measurement philosophy feels risky. Sticking with the same approach in a more sophisticated package feels safer, despite leading to the same fundamental problems.Dig deeper: How attribution masks what’s actually driving growthWhere attribution belongsAttribution isn’t entirely worthless. You need to know its role. Attribution provides a real-time signal for operational decision-making, but don’t take it at face value for strategic budget allocation.The solution is straightforward: augment attribution with learnings from incrementality testing and/or well-built MMM. Apply multipliers, coefficients or adjustment factors — call them whatever you want — to bring attributed numbers closer to causal reality.Email:MktoForms2.loadForm(“https://app-sj02.marketo.com”, “727-ZQE-044”, 16293, function(form) {// form.onSubmit(function(){// });// form.onSuccess(function (values, followUpUrl) {// });});See terms.For example, through testing, bottom-funnel tactics drive many conversions that would happen regardless of ads and end up with a multiplier of less than 1. Mid- and upper-funnel tactics that do not receive appropriate click credit end up with multipliers greater than 1 to account for the halo effect not captured in attribution. While these adjustments don’t maintain perfect accuracy over long periods or through large-scale campaign changes, they provide a more realistic, real-time picture of actual contribution than raw attribution data.Dig deeper: The smarter approach to marketing measurementMTA and triangulationI recently walked a brand through my perspective after they’d invested heavily in building an MTA system but were questioning whether to continue. As we dug into the details, it became clear that their model showed only about 10% of conversions involved multiple touchpoints. That wasn’t true, but it was all their attribution system could see. In the end, their sophisticated MTA setup was effectively delivering the same results as last-click attribution. No better insights. No better decisions. No added value.My core issue with how MTA vendors talk about triangulation is combining MTA, MMM and incrementality testing. While I agree with some concept elements, the “M” and “T” are useless. Instead of layering complexity, brands should anchor their multipliers directly on simpler click-based or platform attribution.The real path forwardWe like attribution because it gives us a single number to grade our marketing efforts. However, there is no perfect way to measure marketing effectiveness, and there never will be. Instead, we need to use a series of tools to better understand what’s working and what’s not and how to adjust our strategy and budget to drive more growth or profit. While I’ve seen attribution (of any flavor) lead brands astray when used in a silo, brands leveraging consistent incrementality testing and MMM are making better decisions. Thankfully, there is no shortage of vendors at every price point, not to mention open-source tooling, that are making better measurement more accessible. The bottom lineMulti-touch attribution overpromises and underdelivers. The sooner marketing leaders accept that attribution cannot solve the fundamental question of incremental impact, the sooner they can invest in measurement approaches that deliver insights that, when acted on, drive better business outcomes and allow them to build marketing programs that are no longer cost centers, but profit centers.Dig deeper: Why causal AI is the answer for smarter marketingThe post It’s time to move on from multi-touch attribution appeared first on MarTech.Source link",

    title: "CNC Vs. Laser: What Are The Pros & Cons Of Each For Woodworking?",
    author: "staff@slashgear.com (Philip Kambutu)",
    description:
      "Woodworkers can use laser cutters and CNC machines for intricate work, but which is best for them will depend on the job and materials. We break it down.",
    content:
      "There are a lot of different kinds of power tools out there for woodworkers who want to amplify their skills (either professionally or as a hobby). Unfortunately, choosing the right one (especially when it comes to woodworking projects, like engraving, that require precision) can be challenging. That's because each tool has a specific kind of cutting and engraving task that it's best suited for. After all, what works best for creating complex 3D contours might not be the best for precise surface etching. This brings us to two of the most debated tools in this space — CNC routers and laser cutters. At a glance, these two tools might look like they belong to the same toolbox. Both use digital designs to automate even the most complex patterns. Plus, they can both cut, shape, or engrave wood into impressive art pieces. But that's where their similarities end. Once you look at how they do it — and the results they deliver — their differences start to matter. CNC routers, for instance, usually use spin bits to carve through a material. This makes them ideal for sculpting complex 3D contours and ploughing through thick hardwood stock. Laser cutters, on the other hand, usually use beams of light to burn a surface. This makes them ideal for creating personalized artworks and 3D puzzles. This is what each tool does best and what you'll want to use them for. If you are serious about woodworking, a CNC router is an essential workshop tool that can undoubtedly boost your production schedules and skills. The reason is that it's versatile and quite valuable for just about every woodworking project. You can use a CNC router to create wall art with intricate designs or even precisely cut thick materials that would take hours to complete. Since this tool uses router bits to carve through a material, it can be quite flexible in making precise cuts on traditional hardwoods and softwoods, plastics, composite materials (including MDF and plywood), and softer metals like aluminum. Apart from versatility and flexibility, another standout benefit is depth control. In fact, there is a reason why the CNC router is great for creating precise 2D and 3D cuts and engravings. Unlike laser cutters that usually burn through the surface, routers usually use bits to create complex 2D and 3D cuts without compromising accuracy. Plus, they always follow a programmed path to deliver consistent results, whether you're cutting joinery, carving a decorative bowl, or engraving custom logos. While it's true that the upfront cost of this machine can be quite high, the machine will last a long time with proper maintenance. Plus, it requires less maintenance, given that you'll only have to replace the bits once they wear down. Lastly, they're better suited for batch production. Once programmed, you can replicate the same design over and over again without starting from scratch — saving both material and time. Since there's no reliance on high heat, you'll avoid discoloration and scorching, problems that are quite common with laser cutters. CNC routers offer unmatched precision and versatility, but that's not to say they're perfect for everyone. In fact, for some workshops, they may introduce more problems than solutions. For one, a CNC router can be quite expensive. While there are budget versions of just about every tool, the sad truth is that even the decent entry-level of this machine can set you back a few hundred dollars. That's even before you factor in the cost of the software and tooling. There is also the issue of the learning curve. At first, you might assume that operating a CNC router is as simple as turning on a table saw. But that's not the case. In fact, to use these high-tech tools, you'll have to learn CAM/CAD software. You'll also have to learn how to properly set up your materials, as mistakes (even minor) could result in wasted wood or machine damage. Another major drawback is the noise and mess that CNC routers create. All that cutting and carving will generate a lot of sawdust and woodchips, making your workspace look messy. Additionally, the whirring spindle and the vacuum system of the CNC routers are often loud during operation. This might not be a significant issue in an industrial setting, but in home workshops (or spaces in residential areas), the sound can be noticeably disruptive. When a woodworking project calls for precision, fine engravings, and meticulous details, laser cutters are hard to beat. After all, these machines use a focused light beam to etch, engrave, or cut wood (all while maintaining a tolerance that is as tight as ± 0.1 mm). This makes them ideal for ornate pieces, custom signage, intricate inlays, and detailed artwork. This also brings about material efficiency, as the kerf (the material removed during cutting) after laser cutting is often barely noticeable, sometimes as low as 0.1 mm. Of course, one of the most satisfying aspects of laser cutting is the smooth edges it produces. The concentrated beam of light seals and polishes the cut as it goes, leaving your pieces with a ready-to-use, professional finish. This might seem like a small benefit, but when you're working on projects where presentation matters (say, display pieces, fine furniture components, or retail products), you'll definitely save a lot of time post-processing. Additionally, since the process involves minimal physical contact with materials — no blade drags the wood — there's reduced risk of chipping or warping delicate pieces, especially veneers. While laser cutters have gained popularity over the years because of their clean finishes, they also come with trade-offs that you should consider before committing to one. For starters, the cutting speed can slow down significantly when tackling a woodworking project. Unlike CNC routers that will handle dense materials without a fuse, the cutting depth and effectiveness of laser cutters (even high-tech models like the XTool P2 ) will fall short once you start working on thicker boards. So, if you plan to build structural furniture pieces, it's best that you consider CNC routers or plasma cutters, which might offer a better solution. Price is also another drawback. While entry-level models might seem affordable (with some ranging between $2000 and $3,000), that price might be a significant barrier for beginners who want to learn woodworking. Also, these affordable models might lack the power to handle serious projects. Apart from that concern, edge quality is another issue. This power tool is known for its unmatched precision, but the cutting method relies on much heat that can char and burn the edges of your material. Not only will this bring a cosmetic problem to the finished product, but it will also affect how well pieces fit together.",

      "TUCSON, Ariz. (KGUN) — Summer break is usually a time for fun, but for dozens of children at We Care Tucson , it's also a chance to dive into science, technology and engineering — for free. We Care Tucson’s Tech Robotics Camp, now in its third year, is designed to introduce STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) concepts to youth from underserved communities. The non-profit organization removes barriers to participation by offering the camp at no cost. “Our mission is to remove the barriers,” said Meme Aguila, Executive Director of We Care Tucson. “So we don’t ask anything of anybody, so anybody can sign up.” The camp is funded through grants and donations, including support from United Healthcare, Tucson Electric Power and Cox Media, as well as others. Inside the cool shelter of the nonprofit's northside headquarters, campers were busy making new friends and assembling working robotic arms. Some, like 9-year-old Maleigha Jimenez, are finding both joy and a good kind of exhaustion. “Every time when I go home, I’m really tired,” Jimenez said. “I haven’t been tired for a long time like this! And it actually makes me really happy.” “I think this is my second or third week, and I love it,” she added. Campers work on increasingly complex STEM projects. This week’s highlight: building a robotic arm that uses gaming controllers to manipulate movement. “And then the right controller controls the upper segment,” said 11-year-old Dean Simpkins while demonstrating his creation. Some former campers have returned as counselors, including Niles King. “Right now, I’m trying to get into law enforcement,” King said. “But I’d love to do IT stuff within that field — maybe cyber-crimes and stuff like that.” Though next week’s robotics session is fully booked, families will have another opportunity to participate at Cyborg Water Wars: The Family Edition, scheduled for July 26.

The transaction marks an important step in thyssenkrupp nucera’s strategy to accelerate innovation and further strengthen its position in the global green hydrogen market. The asset deal includes intellectual property as well as a test facility with a full-size prototype in Skive, Denmark. The purchase price will be settled entirely from available liquid funds; the specific amount has been kept confidential by mutual agreement.Dr. Werner Ponikwar, CEO of thyssenkrupp nucera, states:With this acquisition, we are reinforcing our commitment to driving the green energy transition and deepening our technology leadership in hydrogen. “The high-pressure electrolysis technology developed by Green Hydrogen Systems operates with high efficiency at up to 35 bar – a key advantage for industrial applications where hydrogen is typically required in compressed form. In many cases, this eliminates the need for additional compression. Furthermore, the test facility offers us an excellent opportunity to accelerate and intensify our own research and development activities in a highly practical environment.”Founded in 2007 in Kolding, Denmark, GHS has developed deep expertise in pressurized alkaline electrolysis. By producing hydrogen at higher pressures, the technology reduces or eliminates the need for external compression – making it ideally suited for applications such as pipeline injection, mobility infrastructure, and industrial synthesis processes requiring compressed hydrogen at the point of use. Field-proven through validation at the Skive facility, the technology will accelerate thyssenkrupp nucera’s ongoing R&D into next-generation alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) solutions and support the development of a versatile technology base for customers.Dr. Stefan Hahn, CFO of thyssenkrupp nucera, adds: This transaction aligns well with our long-term technology development roadmap and is built on a solid financial foundation. “It enables cost-efficient technology development and positions us to create long-term value through greater efficiency and innovation.”Subject to the approval of the court-appointed trustee following the issuance of a bankruptcy decree for Green Hydrogen Systems A/S, consent from certain creditors of Green Hydrogen Systems A/S, and the necessary regulatory clearances, the transaction is expected to close in late summer 2025.READ the latest news shaping the hydrogen market at Hydrogen Centralthyssenkrupp nucera Signs an Agreement to Acquire Key Technology Assets from Green Hydrogen Systems, sourceThe post thyssenkrupp nucera Signs an Agreement to Acquire Key Technology Assets from Green Hydrogen Systems appeared first on Hydrogen Central.",

      "Provaris partners with ‘K’ LINE to accelerate hydrogen carrier commercialisation has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with global shipping leader Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd — known as “K” LINE — to advance the commercialisation of Provaris’ compressed hydrogen carriers. The partnership with “K” Line, with its fleet of more than 400 vessels and more than a century of experience in the maritime industry, will support Provaris’ bid to become a leader in the hydrogen transport sector, particularly in Europe, where demand for low-carbon hydrogen is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The MOU outlines a framework for cooperation between Provaris and “K” LINE, focusing on the development, construction, and operation of Provaris’ innovative H2Neo Carrier and H2Leo Barge. The H2Neo Carrier, a purpose-built compressed hydrogen ship, has a carrying capacity of up to 27,000 cubic metres and is designed for regional marine transport. The H2Leo Barge is optimised for near-shore hydrogen storage and delivery, enabling flexible integration with terminal and distribution pipelines. The vessels are engineered to meet stringent safety, emissions, and risk assessment standards. Provaris aims to address Europe’s significant hydrogen import requirements by 2030, with Germany alone projected to import up to 70% of its hydrogen. This collaboration will play a pivotal role in meeting the continent’s ambitious emission reduction goals and contribute to its broader energy transition strategy. As part of the agreement, “K” LINE will provide technical, commercial, and operational assistance, leveraging its vast shipping experience to support the development of Provaris’ hydrogen transport and storage solutions. The collaboration will also incorporate support from Clarksons Norway AS, “K” LINE’s commercial advisor, to refine operational cost models, newbuild programs and charter terms. Provaris managing director and CEO, , said: “We look forward to ‘K’ LINE’s support of Provaris’ development of export project supply chains in the Nordics.” Compressed hydrogen is increasingly recognised as a cost-effective and efficient means of transporting hydrogen over regional distances.

      "Tesla is set to take a major step in expanding its footprint in China, announcing plans to build its first grid-scale energy storage facility in the country. In a statement posted on Chinese social media platform Weibo, Tesla confirmed that the project is designed to help balance electricity supply by providing flexible adjustment of grid resources. The company noted that it will “effectively solve pressures relating to urban power supply.” “After completion, this project is expected to become the largest grid-side energy storage project in China,” Tesla added. The planned facility comes as China pushes for greater integration of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, which can create challenges for grid stability during fluctuating supply periods. By storing excess electricity during periods of low demand and releasing it during peak hours, grid-scale storage systems like Tesla’s are seen as essential to managing the transition toward cleaner energy sources. According to Chinese media outlet Yicai, Tesla Shanghai joined Shanghai officials and China Kangfu International Leasing Co. in a signing ceremony to finalize the deal on Friday. The report said the project involves an estimated investment of 4 billion yuan, equivalent to about $560 million. The announcement arrives during a period of heightened trade tensions between the United States and China. Although negotiators from both countries recently met in London for two days of talks, only a tentative “framework” agreement was reached. A full resolution to the tariff disputes that began during President Donald Trump’s administration has yet to materialize.",

      "[LOS ANGELES] Meta Platforms held discussions with artificial intelligence (AI) search startup Perplexity AI about a possible takeover before moving ahead with a multibillion-dollar investment in Scale AI, according to sources familiar with the matter. The two companies could not come to an agreement and decided not to pursue the deal, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the details of the talks are not public. The financial terms under discussion could not be learned. Perplexity recently closed a new round of funding at a US$14 billion valuation. Meta also attempted to hire Perplexity chief executive officer Aravind Srinivas to join the social media company’s new “superintelligence” team, which is focused on building more powerful AI systems, the sources said. The talks with Meta, which have not previously been reported, highlight Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s willingness to use deals and big hires to catch up in the AI race. The talks took place before Meta finalised a US$14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that gives it a 49 per cent stake in the data-labelling startup. Meta and Perplexity did not respond to requests for comment. Founded in 2022, Perplexity has emerged as one of the most prominent startups using generative AI to rethink core Internet services. Perplexity is taking on Alphabet’s Google by offering an AI tool that summarises search results, lists citations for its answers and helps users refine their queries to get the best responses. The startup is also developing an AI-powered web browser. Frustrated with the pace of Meta’s AI development, Zuckerberg is making a concerted push to poach top AI talent from across the industry with lucrative pay packages. Meta has succeeded in hiring Scale AI’s former CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as top researchers from Google DeepMind and Sesame AI. Not everyone is jumping to join Meta, however. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a podcast this week that some on his staff had been approached by Meta with offers of US$100 million signing bonuses and even bigger compensation packages, but had declined to join the company. Meta has been in talks with former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman to recruit him to the new team, according to sources familiar with the matter. The company has also been working on hiring Daniel Gross, the CEO of Safe Superintelligence, a research lab founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, the source said. Meta has also held early discussions for a computing deal in which Safe Superintelligence would use Meta’s data centre infrastructure, the source said. Representatives for Safe Superintelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Other Big Tech firms, including Google and Amazon.com, have tried to establish themselves as the backbone of the AI ecosystem by providing chips and cloud computing resources to AI startups. Meta has not gone this route to date. BLOOMBERG",
